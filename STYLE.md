# Inspiration

- [utility-types](https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types) by [Piotr Witek](https://github.com/piotrwitek)  
  Early work by Piotr Witek actually became part of the TypeScript spec!
- [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) and [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts) by [Giulio Canti](https://gcanti.github.io/)
  The fp-ts library implements a vast number of abstract algebraic interfaces
  and functional programming paradigms. The io-ts library leverages fp-ts
  implementing run-time type checking and validation. The types... the types are
  beautiful.
- The article [Implementing Arithmetic Within TypeScript‚Äôs Type System](https://itnext.io/implementing-arithmetic-within-typescripts-type-system-a1ef140a6f6f) by [Ryan Dabler](https://medium.com/@ryan.dabler)  
  The math module of this package was largely inspired by this article.

## The Screaming üêç

We use **SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE** for all constants in this code base. That
includes `enum` values. Enum's stepped over the line into run-time land and now
they have to play by the rules.

## Symbols

Symbols are cool. Use them. Imagine an API in multiple languages how do you
refer to the same keys
